How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It narrows down the search space so searching for possible bugs is easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can go to any previous versions for looking up the changes made in the system, and observe the effect of change. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Pros - I get to decide when I choose to save, and hence there will be a logical reason for each commit.

    cons - I can lose some changes I have made if I forgot to save it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Because git is code based VCS and most of the time, for making a logical change, more than one files are chaged.
	so changes in all these files are realted and should belong to one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    first use git log to see the historu og changes and then use git diff to compare any two versions of files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always go back to the prevois stable version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
