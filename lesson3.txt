When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When collabrating with others or when I want to share my code publicly.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because If there are other contributors in my project, I might don'y want thier changes in my local account without
my permission.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forking is like cloning but on github servers only snd not locally. Use it when you want to contribute to someone other's
project and you don't have permission to make changes in their repo.
Branches can be made locally and on github server. use them when we want to work on a new/experimental feature.
cloning is just copying what is there on github to our local repo.
